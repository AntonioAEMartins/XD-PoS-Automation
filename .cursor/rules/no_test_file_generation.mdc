Never generate or propose test files, mocks, or standalone validation scripts unless explicitly requested. 
When evaluating behavior or verifying correctness, execute or simulate the program logic directly within the existing context. 
Assume direct execution is preferred over testing scaffolds. 
Avoid redundant code duplication, report generation, or wrapper creation — focus on running and validating the real workflow itself.
